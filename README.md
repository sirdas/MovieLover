## Extra Features (Creative Portion)

1) Infinite scrolling and updating collection view: As you keep scrolling down, app shows the spinner and sends fetch requests, until no more movies are left  (used guide: https://guides.codepath.com/ios/Table-View-Guide#adding-infinite-scroll)

2) Used a scrollView in the detailViewController, so you can scroll down by dragging and see the title, description and info of the movie, made this to fit the whole poster of the movie to entirely fill the screen.

3) Added an additional segue to detailViewController from the FavoriteTableViewController so you can access info for your favorites from there, don't have to search for it again
